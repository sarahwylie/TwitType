# TwitType

## Description
Back-end structure for a Twitter-type application using Spring Boot as the framework, 
PostgreSQL for testing, 
Lombok to save my fingers a workout,
Mapstruct to map my beans (yum!),  
and Apache Maven as the software project management and build tool.

## Usage
This project stands alone as a back-end only framework. Could I build a front-end? Absolutely! I'm choosing not to, however, so my Java can shine without being clouded over by React or JavaScript or something... 

## Tests
PostgreSQL and Postman were used to test the outcomes in this project.
